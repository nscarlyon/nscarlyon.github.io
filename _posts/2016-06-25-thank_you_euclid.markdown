I used to hate math. No, hate is the wrong word. I abhorred math. Detested it. Math was an intimidating monster that vomited numbers and operations, and somehow, I had to pick out the right chunks from all the mess. It did not help that people assumed I was good at math due to my race . Since math was my Moriarty, I decided that I would not cross paths with any of his friends: scientists, accountants, programmers, and especially mathematicians. I decided that I missed the 'math' gene. 

I felt this way all the way through high school. In my senior year, I started looking seriously at colleges. I found the one - St. John's College (not the one with the basketball team). The school provided a four year required curriculum, meaning everybody graduates with the same degree. Instead of textbooks, students read primary texts for each subject. For instance, we read Aristotle's Categories for Science or Herodotus' Histories for Ancient History. Instead of listening to a professor lecture, our professors, or tutors as we always called them, led about 15 students in a socratic discussion, which is a guided conversation seeking truth. Instead of tests expecting regurgitated answers, the tutors assessed us through essays and oral exams, where we would clarify our thoughts and defend our arguments through conversation. It would be an understatement to say that the school changed me. 

Although there were many aspects of St. John's that transformed my worldview, I will focus on one - mathematics. I was used to memorizing equations and their variations to find some meaningless number (often the wrong one). Math was black and white. If I get the right answer, my grade improves. If I get the wrong answer, I cry. At St. John's College, we start with Euclid's Elements, the father of Geometry, in Freshman year. Through Euclid's Elements, I discovered a man who was not simply writing random numbers, but somebody who was trying to find truth. 

A moment I will never forget is when I understood the Pythagorean Theorem. I knew my high school geometry teacher taught me that the Pythagorean Theorem was a^2 + b^2 = c^2, but I did not understand the reasoning behind this until I saw this picture:

By working through Euclid's logic with my peers, I realized that a, b, and c were lines of a triangle and that the exponents were not just floaty numbers but were actually squares. This transformative moment taught me that mathematics was not a single man's efforts to output data, but rather, a collaborative process to find meaning. It is a way to understand the reality we live in (and sometimes not- hello Leibniz!). It is a discovery of beauty. 

If it was not for this experience, I would have never considered becoming a web developer. As a web developer, I will have ample opportunities to create, explore, and learn. I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
