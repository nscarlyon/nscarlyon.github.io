I just finished reading The Clean Coder:  A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers by Robert Cecil Martin. There were three quotes that really shifted my thinking in coding.

**Test Driven Development**
"If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it!"

Since my program did not emphasize test driven development, all of the projects I worked on during the program could be considered 'rigid'. They are currently working, but because they do not have any tests, they can easily break, so I sometimes I avoid 'flexing' certain aspects of the code. From now on, I will approach new projects with focus on test driven development. I will follow the boy-scout's rule, where I make changes to the code whenever I see it. I will strive to have flexible code.

**Practicing**
"Beautiful though they are, the purpose of learning a kata is not to perform it on stage. The purpose is to train your mind and body how to react in a particular combat situation. The goal is to make the perfected movements automatic and instinctive so that they are there when you need them."

Honestly, this chapter had a profound effect on me. I thought I was practicing when I refactored code, used flash cards to memorize functions, work on technical interview questions, and etc (of course all of these are good things to do). My definition of 'practicing' coding has transformed. I will now set a daily practice time (30 min.-1hr), where I am resolving a problem I have solved before. After I finish solving the problem, I will reflect on my experience and then compare my code the previous attempts. I am really excited about this(I'm looking forward to trying out the famous bowling game kata!)

**Testing Strategies**
"You begin by writing a small portion of a unit test. But within a few seconds you must mention the name of some class or function you have not written yet, thereby causing the unit test to fail to compile. So you must write production code that makes the test compile. But you can't write any more than that, so you start writing more unit test code."

Lately, I have been doing technical interview questions where I would try to write out all the necessary tests first and then the code. If needed, I write more tests. I realize that my method works efficiently on a small scale, but I would like to get into the habit of writing a small portion of a test and then code and then so on. It forces you to design flexible code and think carefully about each step of your program. I will adopt this ping pong style starting with katas and the work my way up to larger projects.

**Final Thoughts**

I believe this book should be on every programmer's bookshelf. It has transformed the way I practice my craft.
I also now have a better understanding of TDD. I will refer to this book often as I progress on the path of
a developer.
