We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

As soon as I read this, I wanted to memorize it so I could better internalize the values. I will explain what I think each line is saying.

**We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.**

I like the word 'uncovering'. It makes it sound as if it is a process/journey that we are still undertaking. It did not say 'we have uncovered'. It then goes onto saying the 'better ways', not the 'best ways'. By using 'better' instead of 'best', it shows an understanding that there is no one 'best way' for every situation. Also, it points again to how 'uncovering' is a never-ending journey. We will never find the 'best way', because the world is always changing, so 'best' can never be a fixed point.

I was trying to think of what are the other ways of developing software besides 'doing it'. A person could read about it, talk about it, or stick to developing software using the same old methods without wanting to change for the better.  At first glance, I thought 'it' referred to 'developing software', but now I believe it refers to 'uncovering'. People like shortcuts, but if you want to truly improve yourself in any field, you need to do it. Not read about it on some blog. You have to do the work.

The Manifesto could have used 'or', but it used 'and' - 'and helping others do it'. Software development is a collaborative process. If you hoard your knowledge, you hurt your team. But the greater danger is keeping knowledge to yourself is really a symptom of arrogance. If you do not want to share what you know, it is a sign that you think others are not worthy of the knowledge. If you think you are better than others, your ability to grow as a software developer is stumped because you will not be able to work with others in a collaborative manner.

**Through this work, we have come to value:**

'Through' is the key word here. You cannot value the things listed in the Manifesto by just simply reading it and nodding your head. You actually have to do the work in order to internalize the values.

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**

This line really resonated with me. When I was a teacher, I had lesson plans, learning manipulatives, and tests to impart my knowledge to the students, but in the end, I always valued the students above all. I also let them know this. I told them that grades are important, but it is far more important to be a person with a great heart than a person with an A. As a way to help them develop a great hear, I explicitly taught them the nine virtues: friendship, courage, honesty, responsibility, citizenship, perseverance, humility, integrity, and wisdom.

**Working software over comprehensive documentation**

At first, I did not understand the meaning behind this because I was not exactly sure what 'comprehensive documentation' meant. This in part is due to my lack of experience in the professional software development field. Through my research, it appears that many teams like to document not only the requirements of the project, but also the time lines for each task, how each task is done, and etc. I could see how a team could be swamped with documentation to the point where it either overwhelmed the members or perhaps, worse, gave them a false sense of productivity. If you have tons of of documentation, but nothing to show your client, then you have no working software. It is more important to have something working than to have a paper saying how something will work.

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**

As humans, I think we tend to quickly get caught up with a vision. We think we know what we want, and then are surprised when reality does not exactly match our desires. This is what happens with contract negotiation. When you enter a project with the expectation that you will be able to lay everything down, you will end up disappointed. A better approach is to start out with a flexible mind. As you progress with development, check in with your client to see if she likes the product so far. During this process, requirements frequently change, so adjustments have to be made or new features added. By taking this collaborative approach with the client, you end up with a better product.

**Responding to change over following a plan**

It's easy to follow a plan. I know this to be true in teaching. In my early days of teaching, there were often times when something unexpected would happen, and instead of transforming it into a teachable moment, I ignored it and followed my lesson plan. However, with time, I got better at responding to a change in my plans. For example, one time a student asked me 'are humans on top of the food chain?' and instead of saying yes and move on with my lesson plan, I opened the question up to a discussion. It was a wonderful discussion, and the lesson was all the more engaging for it. I will keep this in mind as I develop software.

**That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.**

It's important that the Manifesto recognizes there is value in the items on the right. If we ignore the items on the right, we wouldn't be able to properly value the items on the left. I also like how each line starts with the more important value. It gives it more emphasis.

**Final Thoughts**

I do not think the Agile Manifesto is something to be digested once. No, it is like a hearty meal that I must consume at regular intervals. I plan on re-visiting this manifesto after spending some time in the professional software development world. I suspect it will reveal new insights and meaning.
